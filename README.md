# dsr-api build 0

This is the back-end of the digital service report application developed as my final year project during my software engineering degree programme.
You may like to refer to https://github.com/DaybetLee/dsr-app/blob/main/README.md for the front-end of the application.
The application aims to digitalize the process of service reporting, which usually are written on the physical copy by an on-site technician.

This application is builded with MERN (MongoDb, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack and many other dependencies.
You may like to refer to the attached Installation Guide.docx or User Manual.docx if you are interestedd to run the application.
